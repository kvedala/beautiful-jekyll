title: Astronomy - a hobby for the allrounders

For the first time in recorded history, COVID-19 has brought the world together into
experiencing an apocalyptic level hysteria (rightfully or wrongfully). For a generation
that is used to seeing boundary less countries, thanks to a digital era and
where long-distance mobility has become a norm, COVID-19 has effectively shut
the doors on many dreams, plans and memories. The impact of the devastation has
been enormous enough that the definition of time itself has changed to pre
COVID-19 and post COVID-19. The most glaring consequence is its effect on the
mind. Social distancing and lockdowns ensured humans have been deprived of
basic emotional and physical comfort and have been forced to deal with
challenging situations like losing income, career and personal progressions.

It is times like these, however, that show that being alone should not necessarily
translate into being lonely. World has changed. It is not going to be exactly
pre COVID-19 days again, for a long time. Therefore, the onus is on oneself to
remain engaged and ensure loneliness due to being alone, is kept at bay.
Hobbies play a vital role in this endeavour. It has been shown, time and again,
that pursuing hobbies improves mental health keeping depression at bay.[^1] [^2] Many
even classify hobbies into three broad categories: physical hobbies,
intellectual hobbies and spiritual hobbies.

Physical hobbies can include yoga or taking up a
building project in home. Intellectual hobbies can be well known puzzles like
sudoku and crosswords, chess or building a mechanical contraption of a
dragonfly mimic that stimulate the brain. Meditation, studying religion and
self analysis can be classified as spiritual hobbies.

Seldom will one find a hobby that can span all
the three categories. One such exceptional hobby, is astronomy – the study of
celestial objects and phenomena. It is easy, in the context of news articles
that we read of the discoveries being made, to think of the incredible amount
of resources the hobby might require. In fact, that is the very first question
I get when talking about astronomy as a hobby i.e., &quot;how expensive is it
to pursue the hobby?&quot;

Astronomy can be as simple as going to dark skies and simple gazing
at the stars while noting down where certain bright stars-like objects are, any
non-cloud like hazy patches, etc. Doing this over a week can easily lead one to
find out the ecliptic, the imaginary line that moon and certain bright objects
follow. These certain bright objects are planets or the wandering stars! Same
observations over a year can help you see the zodiacal signs, apply simple
high-school mathematical principles to understand [astrology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrology).

Hobbies do not always have to lead to a
scientific discovery but rather a means to engage oneself in the three aspects
of life: physical, intellectual and spiritual. In the above example, the
intellectual and spiritual aspects are quite evident. However, to enjoy the
skies better, one has to move beyond the bright light in the city to a rural
park and camp out the night. It is this camping that certainly adds to the
physical aspect of the hobby and also a reason to be even closer to Mother
Nature. Once you have a small or big telescope to carry, even more physical
labour would be required compounded by the weather.

Well, a look at that ‘Black Blank place' might not show a God, but
witnessing some of celestial events definitely make one wonder on the
incredible complexities of the space that has revolutionized scientific
developments in all branches of science and engineering. Some of these events
that either happened or are to happen during the COVID-19 are:
1. Moon appearing bigger than usual in May – a
        phenomenon called supermoon[^3]
2. Mars Occultation – a rare eclipse like event
     with moon eclipsing Mars by being exactly between Earth and Mars[^4]
3. Jupiter and Saturn conjunctions, bright joint
    guest appearances with their moons[^5]
4. natural light shows like Perseids, Delta Aquarids, Lydrid meteor showers[^6]
5. three different comets being visible at the same
    time before moving on to farther reaches of the solar system, of which comet [NEOWISE (C/2020 F3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_NEOWISE) was
    the most spectacular and visible to the
    naked eyes. The comet [PANSTARRS (C/2017 T2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/2017_T2_(PANSTARRS)) was
    also a spectacular view through 8&quot; and
    bigger telescopes.[^7]
6. Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune being
    visible at the same time.[^8] [^9]

Having started with a camera and a small
refractor in my childhood, I have since upgraded to an 8&quot; f4.9 Newtonian reflector.
This has completely opened up the skies revealing many deep sky objects
including galaxies millions of light years away. The equipment is quite heavy
taking about 20min to setup and thus covers all the necessary hobby elements. (The
red light in the image alongside is to preserve the human eye adaptation to
dark skies. It is always better to not use any white light from smartphones,
car headlights, etc as it will dramatically reduce the visibility of celestial
objects.)[^10]

I have often been fascinated by Astronomy since my
childhood, because it shows the impermanence in permanence. I have been able to
view and take photographs of distinctive celestial highlights like Bubble
nebula, Lunar X (an optical illusion), Local Group of galaxies, Triangulum
galaxy, the many globular and open clusters of stars, famous Virgo cluster of
which our own Milky Way is a part of and the Markarian chain of galaxies in it
that could be photographed with a normal camera.

I have attached some of my best captures during the season
with brief info as presentation slides. Astronomy can be as cost effective or
cost intensive as per one's interest. All that is needed are dark skies and a
childlike curiosity to explore the stars! A gallery of more images from my
collection with acquisition details are available on [astrobin](https://www.astrobin.com/users/kvedala/).

Happy stargazing!!

        These are

        This is a large nebula i.e., a gaseous region
        formed after a sun-like star exhausted all its resources for energy
        production by nuclear fusion and shedding all its remaining mass. The final
        tiny white dwarf can be seen in the middle of the nebula. This can been seen
        using binoculars.

        A globular cluster in the Milky Way Galaxy -
        is the brightest visible in the night sky. This looks like a faint star to
        the naked eyes and small binoculars revels the fuzzball like structure of the
        cluster. The yellow stars are sun-like stars that are older than the brighter
        and younger blue stars in the middle.

        This was also a chance imaging. I had no idea
        of the existence of NGC 7635 until this image. I found the M52 and was taking
        images of it. When correcting the image for and light saturation,
        the pretty pink patch and the ring-like bubble popped up.

        Once of our neighboring galaxies that is very
        faint but large. The galaxy is an example wherein there is no central
        super-massive blackhole. Faint cloudy arms are made of thousands of stars
        while bright the blue and purple areas are nebulae in that galaxy.

        This really faint and far away galaxy looked
        like a circular cloud when the skies were very clear. But this short exposure
        image reveals the detailed structure of the spiral arms, the bright nebulous
        regions and the galactic core.

        The visible part is the tidal shockwave due to
        stellar wind and radiates in visible spectrum. DSLR cameras block much of IR
        light and hence much of it is still not visible. This image was taken using
        the DGM optics Nebula filter.<br/>
        Formed from the remains of a dead star that is
        not visible anymore. The star that is brightening it is a different star. the
        whole system is so large that light takes 26 years to travel from one end to
        the other.
